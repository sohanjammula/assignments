    "# Purpose of Forward Propagation in a Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward propagation in a neural network is the process of passing input data through the network layers to obtain the output predictions. The purpose of forward propagation is to compute the output of the network based on the current parameters (weights and biases) of the model. Here's a more detailed breakdown of its purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prediction Generation**: For a given input, forward propagation calculates the predicted output by applying a series of transformations through the network layers. Each layer processes the input it receives and passes the result to the next layer until the final output layer is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loss Calculation**: The output obtained from forward propagation is used to calculate the loss (or error) by comparing the predicted output to the true target values. This loss quantifies how well the network's predictions match the actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Guiding Backpropagation**: The loss calculated from the forward propagation is used in backpropagation, which adjusts the network's parameters to minimize the loss. During backpropagation, the gradients of the loss with respect to the network's parameters are computed, and these gradients are then used to update the parameters to improve the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Inference**: In practical applications, forward propagation is used to make predictions on new, unseen data. Once a neural network is trained, forward propagation is employed to generate outputs for new inputs based on the learned weights and biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, forward propagation is crucial for both training and inference in a neural network. During training, it helps calculate the loss necessary for parameter updates, and during inference, it provides the mechanism for generating predictions.\n"

    "- **Role in Transformation**: Weights are used to linearly transform the input data. Each input feature is multiplied by a corresponding weight. The weight matrix \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) determines the strength and direction of the relationship between inputs and neurons in the next layer.\n",

    "### Purpose of the Softmax Function\n",
    "1. **Probability Distribution**:\n",
    "   - The softmax function converts the raw output scores (logits) from the network into a probability distribution over the predicted output classes. This is done by exponentiating each output and then normalizing by the sum of all exponentiated outputs.\n",
    "   \n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Interpretable Output**:\n",
    "   - The output of the softmax function is a vector of values between 0 and 1 that sum to 1. This makes the output interpretable as probabilities, where each value represents the probability that the input belongs to a particular class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Facilitates Loss Calculation**:\n",
    "   - Using the softmax function allows the use of categorical cross-entropy as the loss function, which is a standard choice for multi-class classification problems. The cross-entropy loss measures the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the true distribution (one-hot encoded target).\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Compatibility with Cross-Entropy Loss**:\n",
