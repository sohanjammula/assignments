    "## Why and When to Use `while` Loop in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use a `while` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "A `while` loop in Python is used when you want to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. It is particularly useful in scenarios where you do not know in advance how many times the loop needs to execute. The `while` loop continues executing as long as the condition evaluates to `True`, and it stops when the condition becomes `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use a `while` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **When the Number of Iterations is Unknown**:\n",
    "   - Use a `while` loop when the number of iterations cannot be determined before the loop starts. For example, reading input from a user until they provide valid data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Infinite Loops with Break Conditions**:\n",
    "   - Use a `while` loop to create an infinite loop with a break condition inside. This is useful for scenarios like continually checking for new messages or events until a termination condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Waiting for External Conditions**:\n",
    "   - When you need to wait for a certain external condition to change, such as waiting for a user to perform an action or for a process to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of a `while` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a `while` loop that asks the user to guess a secret number until they guess it correctly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Secret number\n",
    "secret_number = 7\n",
    "\n",
    "# User's guess initialization\n",
    "guess = None\n",
    "\n",
    "# Loop until the user guesses the correct number\n",
    "while guess != secret_number:\n",
    "    # Get user's guess\n",
    "    guess = int(input(\"Guess the secret number (between 1 and 10): \"))\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Check if the guess is correct\n",
    "    if guess < secret_number:\n",
    "        print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n",
    "    elif guess > secret_number:\n",
    "        print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n",
