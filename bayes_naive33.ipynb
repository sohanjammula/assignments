    "Bernoulli Naive Bayes handles missing values by considering them as a separate category or state of the feature. In other words, when encountering a missing value for a feature, Bernoulli Naive Bayes treats it as an additional category alongside the existing categories (e.g., presence and absence) for binary features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Bernoulli Naive Bayes typically handles missing values:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imputation:\n",
    "\n",
    "One common approach is to impute the missing values with a placeholder value that represents the absence of the feature. For binary features, this placeholder value could be 0, indicating the absence of the feature.\n",
    "By imputing missing values with a placeholder value, the missing values are treated as if the feature is absent, which aligns with the binary nature of the features in Bernoulli Naive Bayes.\n",
    "Separate Category:\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, Bernoulli Naive Bayes can treat missing values as a separate category or state of the feature.\n",
    "In this approach, a missing value is considered as a distinct category alongside the existing categories (e.g., presence and absence) for binary features.\n",
    "When calculating probabilities, the presence of a missing value is treated as a separate event with its own likelihood.\n",
    "Model Adaptation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli Naive Bayes models can be adapted to explicitly handle missing values by modifying the probability estimation process.\n",
    "For example, the model can estimate separate probabilities for observing a missing value in each class, similar to how it estimates probabilities for observing the presence or absence of the feature.\n",
    "This adaptation allows the model to learn from the available data and make predictions even when some feature values are missing.\n",
    "Overall, Bernoulli Naive Bayes can handle missing values by treating them as a separate category or by imputing them with a placeholder value that represents the absence of the feature. The specific approach depends on the implementation and the requirements of the problem at hand."

    "Yes, Gaussian Naive Bayes can be used for multi-class classification tasks. Gaussian Naive Bayes is an extension of the Naive Bayes algorithm that assumes continuous features follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution. It is commonly used for classification tasks where the features are continuous variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of multi-class classification, where there are more than two classes to predict, Gaussian Naive Bayes can still be applied. The algorithm calculates the probability of each class given the observed feature values using Bayes' theorem and assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class label.\n",

    "Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "While Naive Bayes classifiers are simple and efficient, they make strong independence assumptions between features, which may not hold true in real-world datasets.\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers may perform poorly when the features are highly correlated or when the feature space is high-dimensional.\n",
    "Another limitation of Naive Bayes is its sensitivity to imbalanced datasets, where the class distribution is skewed, leading to biased predictions.\n",
    "Overall, the choice of the best-performing variant of Naive Bayes depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the classification task. It is essential to consider the strengths and limitations of each variant when selecting the appropriate classifier for a given problem. Additionally, further experimentation and analysis may be required to fine-tune the classifier's performance and address any observed limitations.\n",
