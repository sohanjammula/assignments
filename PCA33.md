## Q1. What are Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors? How are they related to the Eigen-Decomposition approach? Explain with an example.

## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors in Eigen-Decomposition

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are essential concepts in linear algebra, particularly in the context of matrix operations and transformations. They play a crucial role in the Eigen-Decomposition approach, which decomposes a square matrix into its constituent eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:

- **Eigenvectors**: An eigenvector of a square matrix \( A \) is a non-zero vector \( v \) that, when multiplied by \( A \), results in a scalar multiple of itself. In equation form, \( Av = \lambda v \), where \( \lambda \) is the corresponding eigenvalue.

- **Eigenvalues**: Eigenvalues are the scalar values \( \lambda \) that satisfy the equation \( Av = \lambda v \). They represent the scaling factor by which the corresponding eigenvectors are stretched or shrunk when transformed by the matrix \( A \).

### Eigen-Decomposition:

Eigen-Decomposition is an approach used to decompose a square matrix into its constituent eigenvectors and eigenvalues. For a square matrix \( A \), the Eigen-Decomposition is expressed as \( A = Q \Lambda Q^{-1} \), where:
- \( Q \) is the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of \( A \).
- \( \Lambda \) is the diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of \( A \).
- \( Q^{-1} \) is the inverse of the matrix \( Q \).

### Example:

Consider a 2x2 matrix \( A \):

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 \\ 1 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \]

To find the eigenvalues \( \lambda \) and eigenvectors \( v \) of \( A \), we solve the equation \( Av = \lambda v \).

1. **Eigenvalues**: We solve the characteristic equation \( \text{det}(A - \lambda I) = 0 \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. For matrix \( A \), we have:

\[ \text{det} \left( \begin{bmatrix} 3 - \lambda & 1 \\ 1 & 3 - \lambda \end{bmatrix} \right) = (3 - \lambda)^2 - 1 = \lambda^2 - 6\lambda + 8 = 0 \]

Solving this quadratic equation yields eigenvalues \( \lambda_1 = 2 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 4 \).

2. **Eigenvectors**: For each eigenvalue, we solve the equation \( (A - \lambda I)v = 0 \) to find the corresponding eigenvectors.

For \( \lambda = 2 \):
\[ (A - 2I)v = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}v = 0 \]
Solving this equation yields an eigenvector \( v_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \).

For \( \lambda = 4 \):
\[ (A - 4I)v = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix}v = 0 \]
Solving this equation yields an eigenvector \( v_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

So, the Eigen-Decomposition of matrix \( A \) is:

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 4 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}^{-1} \]

In this example, the eigenvectors and eigenvalues obtained through Eigen-Decomposition provide a way to understand the behavior of the matrix \( A \) and its transformations on vectors.

## Q3. What are the conditions that must be satisfied for a square matrix to be diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach? Provide a brief proof to support your answer.

## Conditions for Diagonalizability using Eigen-Decomposition

To be diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach, a square matrix \( A \) must satisfy the following conditions:

1. **Square Matrix**:
   - \( A \) must be a square matrix, meaning it must have the same number of rows and columns.

2. **Linearly Independent Eigenvectors**:
   - \( A \) must have \( n \) linearly independent eigenvectors, where \( n \) is the size of the matrix.

### Proof:

Let \( A \) be an \( n \times n \) square matrix.

1. **Existence of Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**:
   - For a square matrix \( A \), we can find its eigenvalues \( \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n \) and corresponding eigenvectors \( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \) by solving the equation \( Av = \lambda v \), where \( v \) is an eigenvector and \( \lambda \) is the corresponding eigenvalue.

2. **Linear Independence of Eigenvectors**:
   - The eigenvectors \( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \) associated with distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent. Each eigenvector corresponds to a distinct eigenvalue, and the set of eigenvectors associated with distinct eigenvalues is guaranteed to be linearly independent.
   - If \( A \) has \( n \) distinct eigenvalues, then the matrix is guaranteed to have \( n \) linearly independent eigenvectors, satisfying the condition for diagonalizability.

3. **Diagonalization**:
   - If \( A \) has \( n \) linearly independent eigenvectors, we can construct a matrix \( Q \) whose columns are the eigenvectors of \( A \). The diagonal matrix \( \Lambda \) contains the eigenvalues of \( A \). Thus, \( A \) can be diagonalized as \( A = Q \Lambda Q^{-1} \).

Therefore, the conditions for a square matrix to be diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach are satisfied when the matrix has \( n \) linearly independent eigenvectors, corresponding to the distinct eigenvalues of the matrix.

The spectral theorem is a fundamental result in linear algebra that establishes the existence of a complete set of eigenvectors for a Hermitian or symmetric matrix. In the context of the Eigen-Decomposition approach, the spectral theorem is significant for several reasons:

### 1. Diagonalizability of Hermitian or Symmetric Matrices:

- **Spectral Theorem**: The spectral theorem states that every Hermitian or symmetric matrix \( A \) can be diagonalized using an orthogonal matrix \( Q \) composed of its eigenvectors, i.e., \( A = Q \Lambda Q^T \), where \( \Lambda \) is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of \( A \).

- **Diagonalizability**: The spectral theorem ensures that certain classes of matrices, such as Hermitian or symmetric matrices, are always diagonalizable. This property simplifies the analysis of such matrices and facilitates various computational tasks.

### 2. Orthogonality of Eigenvectors:

- **Orthogonal Matrix \( Q \)**: The matrix \( Q \) in the spectral decomposition is orthogonal, meaning its columns (eigenvectors) are orthogonal to each other and have unit norm.

- **Orthogonal Transformations**: The orthogonality of \( Q \) ensures that the transformation represented by \( Q \) preserves distances, angles, and shapes, making it particularly useful for geometric and geometrically interpretable operations.

### 3. Relation to Eigen-Decomposition:

- **Eigen-Decomposition**: The spectral theorem provides the basis for the Eigen-Decomposition approach, where a square matrix is decomposed into its constituent eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

- **Spectral Decomposition**: For a Hermitian or symmetric matrix \( A \), the Eigen-Decomposition yields a spectral decomposition \( A = Q \Lambda Q^T \), where \( Q \) contains the eigenvectors and \( \Lambda \) contains the eigenvalues.

### Example:

Consider the following symmetric matrix \( A \):

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix} \]

1. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**:
   - Solving \( \text{det}(A - \lambda I) = 0 \) yields eigenvalues \( \lambda_1 = 4 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 1 \).
   - Corresponding eigenvectors are \( v_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \) and \( v_2 = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

2. **Spectral Decomposition**:
   - Constructing the orthogonal matrix \( Q \) with eigenvectors as columns and diagonal matrix \( \Lambda \) with eigenvalues yields the spectral decomposition \( A = Q \Lambda Q^T \).

### Conclusion:

The spectral theorem is significant in the Eigen-Decomposition approach as it guarantees the diagonalizability of Hermitian or symmetric matrices, establishes the orthogonality of eigenvectors, and forms the basis for spectral decomposition, facilitating various computational and analytical tasks in linear algebra.

## Can a Matrix Have More Than One Set of Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues?

No, a matrix cannot have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues unless it is a scalar multiple of another matrix. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are unique for a given matrix, up to scalar multiples.

### Explanation:

1. **Unique Eigenvectors**: For a given matrix \( A \), the eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent and unique. However, if a matrix has repeated eigenvalues, it may have multiple linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to each repeated eigenvalue.

2. **Unique Eigenvalues**: Eigenvalues are also unique for a given matrix. While it's possible for a matrix to have repeated eigenvalues, each eigenvalue corresponds to a unique set of eigenvectors.

3. **Multiplication by a Scalar**: If a matrix \( A \) is multiplied by a scalar \( k \) to form another matrix \( B = kA \), then \( B \) will have the same eigenvectors as \( A \), but the eigenvalues will be scaled by the same factor \( k \).

### Example:

Consider the matrix \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \).

- \( A \) has two distinct eigenvalues: \( \lambda_1 = 2 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 3 \).
- Corresponding eigenvectors are \( v_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \) and \( v_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), respectively.

The eigenvectors and eigenvalues for matrix \( A \) are unique. If we scale matrix \( A \) by a scalar, the eigenvectors remain the same, but the eigenvalues are scaled accordingly.

Therefore, a matrix cannot have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, unless it is a scalar multiple of another matrix.
