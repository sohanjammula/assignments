    "## Stationary vs. Non-Stationary Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the distinction between stationary and non-stationary time series is crucial for selecting appropriate forecasting models and ensuring accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stationary Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "A time series is considered stationary if its statistical properties, such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation, are constant over time. In other words, a stationary time series does not exhibit trends or seasonality, and its behavior is consistent throughout its duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics of Stationary Time Series**:\n",
    "- Constant mean over time.\n",
    "- Constant variance over time.\n",
    "- Autocorrelations that depend only on the lag between observations and not on the time at which they are calculated.\n",
    "- No long-term trends or seasonal patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "Daily temperature deviations from a long-term average (assuming the climate is stable).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Stationary Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "A non-stationary time series has statistical properties that change over time. It may exhibit trends, changing variances, or seasonality, making its behavior inconsistent over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics of Non-Stationary Time Series**:\n",
    "- Changing mean over time.\n",
    "- Changing variance over time.\n",
    "- Autocorrelations that change depending on the time at which they are calculated.\n",
    "- Presence of trends and/or seasonal patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "Monthly sales data for a retail store that shows increasing sales due to growth in customer base and seasonal spikes during holiday periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing for Stationarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Several tests can determine whether a time series is stationary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visual Inspection**:\n",
    "   - Plotting the time series and visually inspecting for trends or seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "    plt.plot(time_series)\n",
    "    plt.title('Time Series Plot')\n",
    "    plt.xlabel('Time')\n",
    "    plt.ylabel('Value')\n",
    "    plt.show()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test**:\n",
    "   - A statistical test where the null hypothesis is that the time series is non-stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller\n",
    "\n",
    "    result = adfuller(time_series)\n",
    "    print('ADF Statistic:', result[0])\n",
    "    print('p-value:', result[1])\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **KPSS Test**:\n",
    "   - Another test for stationarity where the null hypothesis is that the series is stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import kpss\n",
    "\n",
    "    result = kpss(time_series)\n",
    "    print('KPSS Statistic:', result[0])\n",
    "    print('p-value:', result[1])\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Impact of Stationarity on Forecasting Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The stationarity of a time series significantly influences the choice of forecasting model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stationary Time Series**:\n",
    "   - **ARIMA Model**: For stationary series, the AR (AutoRegressive) and MA (Moving Average) components can effectively model the data without differencing.\n",
    "   - **AR Model**: AutoRegressive models assume stationarity and use past values to predict future values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-Stationary Time Series**:\n",
    "   - **ARIMA Model with Differencing**: For non-stationary series, the 'I' (Integrated) component of ARIMA models accounts for differencing to achieve stationarity. Differencing removes trends and stabilizes the mean.\n",
    "   - **SARIMA Model**: For series with both non-stationarity and seasonality, the SARIMA model extends ARIMA by including seasonal differencing and seasonal AR and MA components.\n",
    "   - **Exponential Smoothing Models**: Methods like Holt-Winters can handle trends and seasonality in non-stationary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transforming Non-Stationary Data to Stationary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Differencing**:\n",
    "   - Subtracting the previous observation from the current observation. First-order differencing removes linear trends, while seasonal differencing removes seasonal effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    differenced_series = time_series.diff().dropna()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Log Transformation**:\n",
    "   - Applying a logarithm to stabilize the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "    log_series = np.log(time_series)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Detrending**:\n",
    "   - Removing the trend component from the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from scipy.signal import detrend\n",
    "\n",
    "    detrended_series = detrend(time_series)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The stationarity of a time series is a fundamental concept that affects the choice of forecasting model. Stationary series can be effectively modeled using ARIMA without differencing, while non-stationary series require transformations like differencing or specialized models like SARIMA to achieve accurate forecasts. Proper testing and transformation of time series data ensure the validity and reliability of the chosen forecasting models.\n"

    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction to Autoregression Models\n",
    "- **Autoregression (AR) Models**: Autoregression models are a type of statistical model used for analyzing and forecasting time series data. In an AR model, the current value of the time series is expressed as a linear combination of its previous values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Model Definition\n",
    "- **AR Model Equation**: An AR model of order \\( p \\) (AR(p)) is defined as:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  Y_t = c + \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\phi_i Y_{t-i} + \\epsilon_t\n",
    "  \\]\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: The Moving Average (MA) model is a time series model that predicts the next observation based on a linear combination of past prediction errors. \n",
    "- **Equation**: The MA model of order \\( q \\) (MA(q)) is defined as:\n",
    "  \\[ Y_t = \\mu + \\epsilon_t + \\theta_1 \\epsilon_{t-1} + \\theta_2 \\epsilon_{t-2} + \\ldots + \\theta_q \\epsilon_{t-q} \\]\n",
    "  where:\n",
    "  - \\( Y_t \\) is the observed value at time \\( t \\).\n",
    "  - \\( \\mu \\) is the mean of the time series.\n",
    "  - \\( \\epsilon_t \\) is the white noise error term at time \\( t \\).\n",
    "  - \\( \\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\ldots, \\theta_q \\) are the parameters of the model representing the weights of the past prediction errors.\n",

    "### Differences from Other Time Series Models\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Autoregressive (AR) Model**:\n",
    "   - **AR Model Equation**: \\( Y_t = c + \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\phi_i Y_{t-i} + \\epsilon_t \\)\n",
    "   - **Difference**: AR models predict the next observation based on a linear combination of past observations, while MA models predict based on past prediction errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) Model**:\n",
    "   - **ARMA Model Equation**: Combines both AR and MA components: \\( Y_t = c + \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\phi_i Y_{t-i} + \\epsilon_t + \\sum_{i=1}^{q} \\theta_i \\epsilon_{t-i} \\)\n",
    "   - **Difference**: ARMA models incorporate both past observations and past prediction errors for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model**:\n",
    "   - **ARIMA Model Equation**: ARIMA models include differencing to make the time series stationary: \\( \\nabla^d Y_t = c + \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\phi_i \\nabla^d Y_{t-i} + \\epsilon_t + \\sum_{i=1}^{q} \\theta_i \\epsilon_{t-i} \\)\n",
    "   - **Difference**: ARIMA models integrate differencing to handle non-stationarity, along with AR and MA components.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) Model**:\n",
    "   - **SARIMA Model Equation**: Extends ARIMA to incorporate seasonal components: \\( Y_t = c + \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\phi_i Y_{t-i} + \\epsilon_t + \\sum_{i=1}^{q} \\theta_i \\epsilon_{t-i} + \\sum_{i=1}^{P} \\Phi_i Y_{t-i} + \\sum_{i=1}^{Q} \\Theta_i \\epsilon_{t-i} \\)\n",
    "   - **Difference**: SARIMA models account for seasonal patterns in addition to trend and random fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of MA Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: MA models are capable of capturing complex patterns in the time series data by considering past prediction errors.\n",
    "- **Handling Non-Stationarity**: MA models can handle time series data with non-stationary behavior by incorporating the effects of past prediction errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of MA Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpretability**: Interpreting the coefficients of MA models might be more complex compared to AR models due to their dependence on past prediction errors.\n",
    "- **Data Requirements**: MA models require a sufficient amount of historical data to estimate the parameters accurately, especially for higher-order models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the Moving Average (MA) model is a valuable tool in time series analysis, offering flexibility in capturing complex patterns and handling non-stationarity in data.\n"
