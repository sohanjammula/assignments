    "Ridge Regression shares many of the assumptions of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, as it is a variation of linear regression. However, there are some additional considerations due to the introduction of the regularization term. Here are the key assumptions of Ridge Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: Ridge Regression assumes that the relationship between the independent variables (predictors) and the dependent variable (outcome) is linear. This means that changes in the predictors result in proportional changes in the outcome.\n",
    "Independence of Errors: Like OLS regression, Ridge Regression assumes that the errors (residuals) are independent of each other. This means that there should be no systematic patterns or correlations among the errors.\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: Ridge Regression assumes that the variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the predictors. In other words, the spread of the residuals should be consistent across the range of predictor values.\n",
    "Multicollinearity: Ridge Regression is particularly useful when multicollinearity is present in the dataset. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more predictors are highly correlated with each other. Ridge Regression helps mitigate multicollinearity by shrinking the coefficients towards zero.\n",
    "Regularization Parameter Selection: Ridge Regression assumes that an appropriate value for the regularization parameter (\n",

    "Overall, while Ridge Regression relaxes some of the assumptions of OLS regression by addressing multicollinearity and overfitting, it still relies on the fundamental assumptions of linear regression, including linearity, independence of errors, and homoscedasticity. Additionally, it introduces the assumption that an appropriate value for the regularization parameter is chosen to balance bias and variance effectively."

    "Scaling:\n",
    "Before fitting a Ridge Regression model, it is often recommended to scale the predictor variables, particularly if they are on different scales or have different units.\n",
    "Scaling ensures that each predictor contributes to the regularization term equally, preventing predictors with larger scales from dominating the penalty.\n",
    "Common scaling methods include standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) or normalization (scaling to a specified range, such as [0, 1]).\n",
    "Interaction Terms:\n",

    "Interaction terms capture the joint effects of two or more predictors on the outcome variable and can improve the model's predictive performance.\n",
